The top folder contains all the required files of 4*4 vedic multiplier.(.mag, .ext, .sim and file used to simulate on irsim) which is basically 4_multiplier followed by the extensions.

Within the submodule folder we have included files of sub functional blocks of the multiplier which includes .mag file, .sim file and the command file used to simulate on irsim  - Ripple carry adder(4_adder) and 2*2 multiplier(2_multiplier) 

Multiplier_1 followed by extensions refers to the normal 4*4 array multiplier layout design. 

The project was to compare no of cells and area used by 4*4 array multiplier compared to vedic multiplier.
